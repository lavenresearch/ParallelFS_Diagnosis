ParallelFS_Diagnosis
====================
This project is an implication of the paper[^1] from FAST'10. The problem it solved is to locate stragglers which is hard to identify and may lead to overall system performance degradation in parallel file system. More over, the reason that cause straggler is also analyzed.
